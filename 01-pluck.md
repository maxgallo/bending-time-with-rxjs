# Pluck

_TAKEAWAYS_

- Passing the observable `player$` as parameter keeps
things easy for testing.

- AVA is able to understand that we're returing an observable

- Using `bufferCount` to buffer for all the events


__QUESTIONS__

- What is the value of the variable `expected` ?

- What happen if I remove the `return` statement ?
